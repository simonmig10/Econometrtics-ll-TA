# calculating cyclical correlation 


Recall from lecture 1: ty was our detrended series using linear
detrending method hpy was our detrended series using HP filter

```{r}
library(stats)

plot(ty, type="l")
plot(hpy, type="l")
```

```{r}
cc <- ccf(as.numeric(ty),as.numeric(hpy), lag.max=1, pl = F)
```

```{r}
plot(cc, ci=0.95, ylab="", xlab="", main="") 
```
